# OBJECTIVES OF THE DATABASE
•	Support the company’s diversified businesses by providing a central repository for all operational data.
•	Enable the company to implement initiatives such as 360-degree customer view and a conglomerate-wide loyalty program.
•	Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the company’s data management operations.
•	Facilitate reporting and business intelligence across the different business units.
# KIND OF DATABASE
The kind of database that would be suitable for this project is a Relational database. A relational database allows you to create structured relationships between different types of data, which is essential when dealing with diverse business units and their unique data requirements.
They are well-suited for storing and managing complex data structures, and they are relatively easy to scale and maintain.
# CHARACTERISTICS OF THE DATABASE
•	Data manipulation language: The database will use the Structured Query Language (SQL) as its data manipulation language. SQL is a standard language for querying and managing relational databases.
•	Source of data: the database will incorporate data from various sources, including data entry through user interfaces, data imports from external sources and potentially data generated by the company’s different business systems.
# NORMALIZATION PROCESS
Normalization is a process that helps in organizing data in a relational database. It involves breaking down large tables into smaller ones and establishing relationships between them. This helps in reducing redundancy and improving data integrity.
•	First Normal Form (1NF): Ensure that each column contains only atomic (indivisible) values.
•	Second Normal Form (2NF): Organize data to eliminate partial dependencies. In other words, make sure that data depends on the entire primary key, not just a part of it.
•	Third Normal Form (3NF): Eliminate transitive dependencies between non-key attributes.
The database will be normalized to the third normal form (3NF). 3NF is a level of data normalization that ensures that the database is efficient and that data is not duplicated.
# DATABASE DESIGN SHEMA
The database will use a relational database schema. Relational database schemas are made up of tables, which are collections of related data.
It is widely used in various industries and provides an efficient way to store structured data.
